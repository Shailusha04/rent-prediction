## Features

- Simulates rental prices with trends and seasonality
- Uses Linear Regression for forecasting
- Evaluates model with MSE and RÂ² Score
- Visualizes rental trends per city

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn (LinearRegression)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

2. Install dependencies:
